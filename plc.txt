Cartridge Path Substitution
The cartridge path controls file lookup for your site and defines what code runs. B2C Commerce searches the cartridge from left to right when a specific controller, script, model, or ISML template is called via URL or code.

You can substitute the cartridge path file lookup with the require() function in these situations.

Relative to the current file: require('./shipping') or require('../../util')
Relative to the current cartridge: require ('~/cartridge/scripts/cart')
From the beginning of the cartridge path: require('*/cartridge/scripts/util/array')
Specific B2C Commerce API: require('dw/catalog/CatalogMgr')
Specific module or cartridge: require('server')

customize b2c sfra
------------------
SFRA comes with an app_storefront_base cartridge and a server module. The base cartridge contains functionality that’s common to most sites. 
You can layer additional functionality over it with plug-in cartridges, LINK cartridges, and custom code cartridges. 
B2C Commerce provides plug-in cartridges for wish lists, gift registries, Apple Pay, and product comparison, as well as middleware capability. 
LINK partners, such as PayPal and Bazaarvoice, provide LINK cartridges. So there’s all kinds of apps to choose from.

**This means that you don’t edit or rename the app_storefront_base cartridge and the other plugins, such as plugin_applepay. It also means that you need to keep your version of the app_storefront_base cartridge and other plugins up to date to get all the changes.


***Keep in mind that the base cartridge and module are not intended to be customized
--Because SFRA is backward compatible between point releases (except when required for urgent security fixes), you can just download a new version and run automated tests. No more searching for code changes so you can port it to the customized code.

!!!!High imp
-------
Each site must have at least one custom cartridge. If you want to create multiple sites, we suggest you create multiple custom cartridges that separate functionality specific to a brand or locale. This lets you reuse most of the cartridge stack for a new site or microsite.
