ideal way
------------
from staging code and data are replicated to dev and prod.

Developers work and test on dev env only.
Then data and code are replicated to prod environment.

Builds are built on dev, staging only not on prod. only replication done to prod.


data replication - data will be replicated
code replication - active version and other version we can replicate

in prod, we can undo code and data replicate(NOTE: only last replication can be undone)
